A starting point...
My main field of work is Behavioural Genetics.  
I have always had a lot to do with computers, and particularly with programming of one sort or the other. I am particularly interested in the concept of Open Source resources, in particular software, of course.
I like the idea of acting as a "catalyst" for the promotion of Open Source computing tools in the field of the Biological Sciences.
